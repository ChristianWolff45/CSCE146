# Code solutions to CSCE146 problems (skills demonstrated)

## CSCE146Homework00 (arrays, for loops)
uses simple math equations and arrays to compute the addition, subtraction and magnitude of vectors

## CSCE146Homework01 (tab delimited file reader)
a game show that asks the player to guess the value of 5 random prizes from a file
the code takes in a tab delimited file of prizes and their corresponding price
if a prize does not have a correctly delimited value it ignores it.
the code then randomly chooses five prizes and asks the player to guess
if the guess is withen 1300 dollars without going over the player wins.

## CSCE146Homework02 (linked lists)
reads in a tab delimited file of video games and their console,
allows the user to search the database using partial names or * as a wild for all results
then stores results in a custom generall linked lists and outputs them to the console or a second file

## CSCE146Homework03 (linked lists)
Uses an array of linked lists in order store tasks sorted by their priority
can read from a tab delimited file or users manual inputs
can also delete any given task by entering the task and its priority

## CSCE146Homework04 (Linked List queues)
A robot traversal game
Takes in a file that represents the board X for obstacles _ for safe spaces
Starts the the player in the top left corner
then takes in a file of moves for the robot moves
the code stores the commands in a linked list based queue
and prints out the new board after processing every command

## CSCE146Homework05 (recursion)
A simple recursive algorithm that creates a triangle
ith ever increasing upside down triangles cut out from inside it

## CSCE146Homework06 (Heaps)
A sheep shearing scheduler that minimizing the net wait times of all the sheep
reads from a file containing arrival time, shear time and name
reads in all the sheep arriving at minute 0 and adds them to a min heap
as the sheep are sheared it adds more sheep as they arrive always shearing the sheep with the minimum wait time
